            I spend most of my days doing 3 things. Playing computer games,
            being with my girlfriend and playing basketball. I have played video
            games for many years, originally the games like Minecraft and Portal
            2 being the catalysts to my gaming endevours. I currently play alot
            of Leauge of Legends and "osu!". Probably my most time consuming
            activity. Then theres my girlfriend. Her name is Elin. We have been
            together for about 7 months and we try to see eachother 2 or more
            times a week. Last but not least, basketball! My favorite sport. I
            have played basketball for sooon 8 years and i love it. I play for
            the local team "Norrort HU19", which i qualified for a few weeks
            ago. I practice 4 times a week and have matches on the weekends.
