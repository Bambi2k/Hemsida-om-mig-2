      <p>
        I was born on the 29th of July 2004, at Karolinksa sjukhuset aroud 7 in
        the morning. I was born into a family of two, me being the first child
        of my parents Petra and Enri. I grew up in Solna soon accompanied by my
        sister Fiona. As a family we moved quite a bit. I lived in Germany and
        Austria for about 2 years till i moved back to Solna. Then we moved to
        Vallentuna a few years later, and lastly to Täby Ellapark where i now
        live. I attend Åva gymmnasium and study Technology. Thats about it to be
        honest :)
